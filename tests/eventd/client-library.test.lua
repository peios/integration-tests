-- eventd TRM §10.2 — The eventd-client Library.
--
-- eventd-client is a Rust library with no binary of its own. Nothing in the
-- image calls `query`, `Tail`, `text` or `access` except evctl, which uses
-- only its wire framing and output types (evctl/src/main.rs), and
-- whatever evctl does is §10.1's to prove. So the library's own guarantees
-- — whole results or none, how a tail reports, how text is quoted, what
-- `access` and `readable` compute — are proved by its unit tests, cited
-- below and run under ptcargo, or listed as TODO where none exists yet.
--
-- Two anchors are about eventd's behaviour as much as the library's, and
-- those run in a VM: that text a person typed must be quoted because a bare
-- keyword is read as the clause, and that a field-only grant shows records.
