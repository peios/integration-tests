-- eventd TRM §5.5 — metric retention. This file proves:
--
--   * samples older than MetricRetentionDays are deleted and a series with no
--     remaining samples is removed (the only thing that removes a series row);
--     an idle series persists until its last sample goes; the ninety-day
--     default, shown behaviourally; no downsampled replacement is left;
--   * before an affected series loses samples it loses its adaptive rollups,
--     including a series that keeps other samples (every affected series is
--     tracked), so a rollup never answers for expired samples;
--   * over a non-zero byte limit the oldest samples are deleted until the
--     logical live size (free pages excluded) is within it, in transactions of
--     RetentionDeleteBatchRows; both limits apply together; new series are
--     still accepted; VACUUM never runs; a zero limit disables size retention;
--     and the write path never makes the size decision.
--
-- Read-only planning is shown with the metric store's descriptor flags in
-- metricdb-database-lifecycle.test.lua. The permission to append one bounded
-- delete to an open transaction under urgent pressure is documented below.
--
-- Age retention only removes what this file ages out (other series carry
-- recent timestamps), so it shares the file-scope VM. Byte retention deletes
-- the oldest samples store-wide, so it runs on a second, dedicated VM. A pass
-- is kicked by any applied configuration change (config.rs apply_reload sets
-- retention_requested). Peak 2 VMs.
