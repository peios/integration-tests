-- eventd TRM §2.1 (the pipeline) and the backpressure half of §2.3 (the
-- handoff channel) and §2.2 (copying): drain → detect → hand off → write,
-- with the KMES ring as the only buffer, so a writer that falls behind
-- stops the drain thread and the loss shows up as a gap rather than as
-- memory.
--
-- One file-scope VM on one vCPU with the KMES ring seeded to its 64 KiB
-- minimum, so the ring overruns after a few hundred events.
--
-- The lever is a starved writer with a live drain thread. The shard's
-- writer thread is moved to SCHED_IDLE and two busy-loop shells are
-- started at normal priority: on one vCPU the writer then gets almost no
-- CPU while the drain thread (also normal priority) keeps running. A
-- flood from the agent then fills the handoff channel and the ring. If
-- the drain thread could buffer without bound nothing would be lost; that
-- something is lost, and that every lost sequence is inside a gap record,
-- is the behaviour under test. Each starvation is undone in a guarded
-- cleanup (hogs killed, the writer returned to SCHED_OTHER) so later tests
-- see a normal eventd.
--
-- The channel's actual slot and byte bounds are internal and the book
-- gives no number for them, so nothing here asserts one: a bound is shown
-- by comparing two floods that differ only in the property under test.
