-- eventd TRM §5.3 — series resolution: turning each arriving sample into a
-- series_id on the single metric thread. This file proves the observable
-- steps and the cache's visible effects:
--
--   * every stored sample has a resolved series_id;
--   * the canonical label string is computed and hashed;
--   * a histogram's boundary blob keeps the producer's order (eventd never
--     sorts — it rejects a non-increasing set instead);
--   * counters and gauges have a null boundary blob and hash;
--   * a verified match reuses the series_id; a no-match inserts a new row; a
--     type mismatch against the matched series drops the record;
--   * the series cache is bounded by MetricSeriesCacheSize (read through the
--     eventd.metrics.series.cached health gauge) yet never caps series
--     creation, starts empty after a restart and warms on demand.
--
-- The hash-match verification and the by-(name,label_hash) lookup are proven
-- by a label-hash collision (two label sets that FNV-collide stay two
-- series); the changed-histogram-boundaries case is the known-bug below,
-- driven by a boundary-blob collision. Both collisions were found with a
-- Pollard-rho search over the book's FNV-1a parameters and verified against
-- eventd's own hash. The cache's key structure, hit/miss cost and
-- undersized-cache thrash have no observable distinct from the result and are
-- documented as such.
--
-- Two VMs at peak: one file-scope, plus a dedicated VM for the known-bug,
-- which can crash the metric thread.
