-- eventd TRM §9.5 — power loss: what each store's durability setting
-- keeps across a sudden loss of power, and what the next boot's start
-- does about the boundary.
--
-- Two VMs.
--
-- The first ("ev-powerloss") is about how eventd treats a new boot, and a
-- new boot is a new kernel boot ID. A valid UUID that is not this boot's
-- is bound over /proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id and eventd restarted, so
-- it starts as the first start of a boot it has no receipts for. Unlike a
-- real power cycle the KMES ring survives (its sequences are this boot's,
-- not a fresh 1..n), which is what makes "never reconciled against the
-- previous boot's receipts" observable: a reconciling eventd would skip
-- the survivors the old boot's receipts cover; one that keeps the boots
-- apart reads them all again under the new ID.
--
-- The second ("ev-pl-disk") has its three stores on provium-mediated
-- disks (`eventd.boot{store_disk = {}}`): provium holds every write the
-- guest has not flushed, so `power_cut()` discards exactly what was never
-- made durable, and `vm:reset()` is the next boot finding what is left.
-- The power is cut three times on that one VM:
--
--   1. The checkpoint boundary. Log records and metric samples are sent,
--      then a configuration change makes the retention pass checkpoint
--      every store (and sets WalCheckpointPages to its ceiling, so nothing
--      checkpoints again). The main database files are read on their own,
--      without their WALs, to watch the "before" records arrive there.
--      More log records, metric samples and events follow — committed, in
--      the WALs only — and the power goes. The events survive; the logs
--      and metrics after the checkpoint do not; those before it do.
--   2. The in-flight batch. A few events are committed, then the event
--      store's filesystem is frozen (FIFREEZE), so the next batch the
--      writer takes blocks inside its commit and nothing of it reaches the
--      disk. Its events are emitted, the writer is seen blocked (D) in
--      /proc, and the power goes. The committed events survive, the batch
--      does not, and no synthetic.gap appears for it.
--   3. PEI-1317, last because it leaves eventd unable to start: fresh
--      stores, power cut a few seconds after creation.
--
-- ext4 flushes on its own: the journal commits every 5 seconds, and one
-- FLUSH makes the whole of provium's held overlay durable, including WAL
-- frames SQLite never synced. For cut 1 the three store mounts are
-- remounted with commit=600, so what survives is what eventd itself made
-- durable rather than what the filesystem happened to flush meanwhile.
-- (Cut 2 needs no remount: the frozen event store takes no writes at all.)
-- No cut is preceded by `vm:pause()`: QEMU's stop path flushes every
-- block device, which would commit the very writes the cut is to drop.
--
-- The disk VM is seeded ErrorControl=Normal / RestartPolicy=Never (as in
-- bootstrap-failure.test.lua) so the PEI-1317 failure is one failed start
-- rather than peinit's Critical policy rebooting the machine for ever.
-- Nothing else here reads either value.
