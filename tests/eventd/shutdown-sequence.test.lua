-- eventd TRM §8.4 — shutdown: the nine-step sequence, and the peinit stop
-- timeout that bounds it.
--
-- One VM. A clean stop is fast — well under a second — so most of the
-- sequence is read from what it leaves behind: the stores copied out
-- while eventd is down (the final drain and commit, the checkpoint rows,
-- the shutdown record, the WAL files gone), and the socket directory.
--
-- The middle of a shutdown is made observable by holding it open. An
-- idle query connection — connected, never sending — keeps one query
-- handler blocked reading its request for up to QueryTimeoutMs, and the
-- shutdown waits for every handler before it gets past step 1. With the
-- query timeout raised to its maximum and eventd's StopTimeout seeded to
-- a few seconds, a stop sits in that state until peinit gives up and
-- kills it: long enough to look at a shutdown in progress, and the
-- abort at the timeout is the second half of the section.
--
-- eventd is Normal in this VM so that a stop that ends in a kill is not
-- also a Critical failure; it is never restarted by policy here, only by
-- the tests.
