-- eventd TRM §4.4 — log retention: age and size, both enforced, oldest
-- first with no regard to boots, in bounded writer-owned transactions,
-- and never a VACUUM.
--
-- One file-scope VM. Log lines can be backdated at the source — a log
-- record's `timestamp` is the producer's when it gives one — so every
-- test here sends lines that are already as old as it needs. A retention
-- pass is triggered by any applied configuration change
-- (config.rs:1031, `retention_requested`), which is how each test makes
-- the pass happen now rather than at the sixty-minute default interval.
-- Rows from another boot, which no producer can send, are inserted
-- offline: eventd stopped through the service manager, logs.db edited on
-- the host and written back with its -wal and -shm removed, eventd
-- started again.
--
-- Sizes are measured the way the chapter defines them, on a host-side
-- copy of logs.db and its WAL: (page_count - freelist_count) * page_size.
